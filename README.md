# Superstore USA Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

This repository contains the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Superstore USA** dataset using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The analysis covers **univariate, bivariate, multivariate**, and **time series analysis** techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the Superstore USA dataset and draw insights that can help in decision-making. The project covers various types of analysis and visualizations that highlight trends, relationships, and patterns in the data.

## Key Features
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual variables using distributions, histograms, and descriptive statistics.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Understanding the relationship between two variables with correlation, scatter plots, and more.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Delving deeper into the relationships among multiple variables using advanced visualizations.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing trends over time using line plots and other time-based techniques.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
- **Visualizations**: Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for clear, insightful visual representations.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** 
- **NumPy** 
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haroon1056/Superstore-USA-EDA.git

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter, VSCode, etc.).
2. Run the notebook to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains sales information from Superstore USA, including variables like:

- Order Date
- Sales
- Order Priority
- Ship Mode
- Profit
- Quantity
- Discount
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Product Base Margin
- Region
- Customer Information

## Analysis Included
1. **Univariate Analysis**
- Analysis of single variables like Order Priority, Product Category, Customer Segment.
- Histograms, boxplots, and descriptive statistics.
2. **Bivariate Analysis**
- Relationship between sales and profit, Ship Mode and Product Base Margin, etc.
- Scatter plots, heatmaps for correlation.
3. **Multivariate Analysis**
- Multivariable relationships using pair plots and more advanced visualizations.
4. **Time Series Analysis**
- Trend analysis over time for Order Year using countplot.
